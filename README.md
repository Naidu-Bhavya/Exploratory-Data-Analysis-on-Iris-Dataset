# Exploratory Data Analysis on Iris Dataset

# What Is Exploratory Data Analysis?

1)Exploratory data analysis is a task of analyzing the data using simple tools from statistics , some plotting tools , linear algebra.

2)Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step before you jump to machine learning or modeling of your data. By doing this you can get to know whether the selected features are good enough to model, are all the features required, are there any correlations based on which we can either go back to the Data Pre-processing step or move on to modeling.

3)Once Exploratory Data Analysis is complete and insights are drawn, its feature can be used for supervised and unsupervised machine learning modeling.

# Importance of EDA:
Many Data Scientists will be in a hurry to get to the machine learning stage, some either entirely skip exploratory process or do a very minimal job. This is a mistake with many implications, including generating inaccurate models, generating accurate models but on the wrong data, not creating the right types of variables in data preparation, and using resources inefficiently because of realizing only after generating models that perhaps the data is skewed, or has outliers, or has too many missing values, or finding that some values are inconsistent.

# EDA on Iris Dataset:

1) EDA on IRIS dataset, to classify whether a given flower belong to which type. Here the features of flower is taken into consideration after that bivariate, univariate analysis is done on the dataset to find from which feature we are able to classify the type of class.

2)In the Ipython Notebook we will see step by step procedure to perform EDA on a simple dataset( Iris DataSet)

3)Following steps are mentioned in the Ipython notebook along with python code.

            A)Analyzing the Data (High level statistics of the dataset)
            B) Univaraite analysis of data using the following
                    1)1-D Scatter plots
                    2)Histogram and PDF
                    3)CDF
            C)Statistical analysis using Mean, Median, STD, Quantiles and Percentiles
            D)Univariate analysis with BOX plots and Violin plots
            E)Bi-Variate analysis / Multivariate analysis of data using the following
                    1) 2-D Scatter Plots
                    2)Pair-plot (To observe all 2-D Scatter Plot) 
                    3)Multivariate probability density plot or Contour Plot
                    
 4)Above mentioned Exploratory data analysis is performed on Iris data set and observation/ Conclusion from each plot is mentioned clearly in Ipython Notebook
